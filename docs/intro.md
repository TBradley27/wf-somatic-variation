## Introduction

This workflow enables analysis of somatic variation using the following tools:
> [Nanomonsv](https://github.com/friend1ws/nanomonsv) for the somatic SV calling
> [modbam2bed](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/modbam2bed) for the methylated regions calling, and [DSS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html) for the differentially methylated regions detection
> [ClairS](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/ClairS) to call somatic short variants
