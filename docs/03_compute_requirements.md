Recommended requirements:

+ CPUs = 64
+ memory = 256GB

Minimum requirement:

+ CPUs = 12
+ memory = 32GB

Approximate run time: Variable depending on sequencing modality (targeted sequencing or whole genome sequencing), as well as coverage and the individual analyses requested. For instance, a 60X/30X Tumor/Normal pair takes approximately 17h:30m on a 64 core machine with 256Gb of memory.

ARM processor support: False
