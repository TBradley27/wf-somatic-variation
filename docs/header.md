# Somatic variation workflow
**NOTE: this workflow is currently under active development and still doesn't call somatic variation**
This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
to identify somatic variation in a paired control/cancer sample.
This workflow is intended to perform:
> Somatic structural variants calling (SV; in development).
> Differentialy methylated regions (DMR; in development).
> Somatic short variant calling (SNP; in development).
> Short tandem repeat detection (STR; in development).
