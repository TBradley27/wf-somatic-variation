# Somatic variation workflow
**NOTE: this workflow is currently under active development and still doesn't call somatic variation**
This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
to identify somatic variation in a paired control/cancer sample.
This workflow is intended to perform:
 - Somatic short variant calling (SNP).
